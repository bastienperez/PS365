It requires the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to be installed and appropriate permissions to access device management and BitLocker key data.  ## EXAMPLES  ### EXAMPLE 1  ```powershell Get-BitlockerKeyFromIntune -IncludeDeviceInfo -IncludeDeviceOwner ```  This command retrieves BitLocker recovery keys for all Intune managed devices with device and owner information.  ### EXAMPLE 2  ```powershell Get-BitlockerKeyFromIntune -IncludeDeviceInfo -ExportToExcel ```  This command retrieves BitLocker keys with device information and exports to Excel.  ### EXAMPLE 3  ```powershell Get-BitlockerKeyFromIntune -IncludeDeviceInfo -IncludeDeviceOwner -RevealKeys -ExportToExcel ```  This command generates a comprehensive report with BitLocker keys visible in plain text and exports to Excel. WARNING: Use with extreme caution as this exposes sensitive recovery keys!  ### EXAMPLE 4  ```powershell Get-BitlockerKeyFromIntune -IncludeDeviceInfo -BackupToKeyVault "MyBitLockerVault" -ExportToExcel ```  This command retrieves BitLocker keys, backs them up to the specified Azure Key Vault, and exports to Excel.  ## PARAMETERS  ### -IncludeDeviceInfo  Switch to include device information such as device name, OS, compliance status, etc.  ```yaml Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: (All) Aliases:  Required: False Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False ```  ### -IncludeDeviceOwner  Switch to include device owner information (UPN).
