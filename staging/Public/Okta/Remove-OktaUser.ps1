function Remove-OktaUser {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Searches for specific Okta Users and FIRST Deactivates them and on a SECOND pass, deletes them!

            IMPORTANT: If you would like to permanently delete the user, you must retain a list of IDs.
                        The process would look like this.
                        1. Obtain a list of IDs that you would like to hard delete.
                        2. Use this function - $IDList | % {Remove-OktaUserReport -Id $_.Id} # This places the user in a deactivated state
                        3. Repeat step #2 - in otherwords it takes takes two Remove-OktaUser to hard delete
            - If you do not have a list of IDs of the Deactivated users, you cannot query for them via the API, Okta has not exposed it
            - In a pinch you could use F12 when loading https://YourOktaTenant.okta.com/admin/users  ## I USED FIREFOX (BELOW) ##
                - The following GET will be displayed https://YourOktaTenant.okta.com/api/internal/people?filter=EVERYONE
                - Right click it and Select COPY > COPY RESPONSE
                - You will then be able to use:

                Get-Clipboard | ConvertFrom-Json| Select-Object -expand personlist | ? {$_.status -eq 'Deactivated'} | % {Remove-OktaUser -Id $_.id}

                WARNING!!! THIS WILL REMOVE EVERY SINGLE DEACTIVATED USER and IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL YOUR ENTIRE TENANT!!!!!!!!
                BE SURE YOU HAVE TESTED THIS EXTENSIVELY!!!!
                I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR ISSUES!!!
